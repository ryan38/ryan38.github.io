## Introduction
  Out of all the classes that I’ve taken on campus, this software engineering class has been the most impactful one. Not only did I learn a lot about coding, but I also learned a lot of useful tips as well. What I really enjoyed from this class is that everything I learned can be applied outside of school. There were things like development environments, coding standards, design patterns, and so much more. Out of all the things I learned, the two biggest things that really stood out to me was coding standards and testing. 

## Coding Standards
  Coding standards could be considered as rules for coding. It keeps your code clean and readable. It helps people understand what your code is trying to do. Not only is a clean code easier to read, but it also prevents any errors to pop up. Following coding standards will prevent any problems in the future. There are coding standards for each language so that you could prevent yourself from making any errors. This is great for coding in general because it teaches people how to write clean and readable code for any project being worked on.
  
## Testing
  Just as important as following coding standards, testing is a must for projects. Testing a project allows users to see if their updates are either working or crashing. Making multiple changes without testing is problematic because it will be hard to find out where the source of the problem is. The best thing to do is to run a test after each update to make sure that each change doesn’t crash the project. Testing a project constantly during the building phase will ensure a functional project in the end.
  
## Conclusion
  Taking this course has really improved the way that I code. Although this class was about web development, the things that I learned can be applied to other things that involve coding. This class has given me a better understanding on how to code and there’s still room for me to improve. Taking this class has improved my coding skills and I can’t wait to use what I learned to work on more projects.
