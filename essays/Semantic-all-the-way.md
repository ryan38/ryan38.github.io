## Introduction
Creating websites is a great skill to learn. It’s fun to do and it provides more job opportunities. The only downside to it is that it can be confusing to learn. Luckily, there is Semantic UI. Semantic UI allows people to design websites with multiple tools and different options in creativity. Let’s talk about the benefits of using Semantic UI.

## Benefits
As said before, Semantic UI allows people to design websites with multiple tools and different options in creativity. With Semantic UI, people can input different elements such as buttons, dividers, lists, and more. With each element there are multiple options to choose from, each with a displayed example to show people what it looks like. If the user finds the one that they want to use, they could copy the code for it and paste it into their own code. This is very useful because it gives everyone an easier way of adding things to their page without hard coding it, with possible errors, into their code. This allows all users to save time and give multiple options for their website. 

## Conclusion
Creating websites is a great skill to learn. Although it may be difficult to master, Semantic UI provide many tools to use to make it easier on ourselves. Semantic UI allows everyone to easily create their website with multiple options for their design. With this, people will be able to create amazing websites faster than ever. Anybody could use this, and I would highly recommend it to anybody that’s building a website.
