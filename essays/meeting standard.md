	Meeting Standards
By:

Introduction
	Coding can be very confusing, especially to those that are new to it. As we put more time into it, we start to get the hang of reading code. Like writing a report, there are standards that should be followed while coding. These standards could be the amount of spaces to indent, or where to put the curly brace when writing a function. With IntelliJ and ESLint, we can write our code correctly without any errors. In this report I’ll discuss a bit about why these tools are useful in following coding standards.
Usefulness
	While coding on IntelliJ with the ESLint tool, I was able to see all my errors that I made. They were able to me exactly what was wrong with my code, whether it was a grammatical error, or I wrote my code incorrectly. There would be a green check to indicate that your code is working correctly. These tools are incredibly useful in coding because it allows your code to look clean while making it functional. With the ability to see if my code is meeting the standards, I’m able to make my code proper and efficient.
Conclusion
	Coding can be very confusing, especially to those that are new to it. With the help of IntelliJ and ESLint, we can see our errors clearly. These tools allow us to keep our codes clean and follow the coding standards. Its functions will keep us aware of our codes and help us become better coders. What we can learn from these tools could help us in other coding languages as well. I highly suggest for people who are new to coding to use IntelliJ and ESLint. It is a life savior.
